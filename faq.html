        <h2>3. Do you pressure wash roofs?</h2>
        <p>No; high-pressure services will damage composition shingle roofs, and we will never do this. Instead, we clean roofs with our proprietary highly effective but environmentally safe chemical blend.</p>

        <h2>4. How often should I have my property pressure washed?</h2>
        <p>Frequency of service depends on factors such as your property's location, exposure to dirt and debris, and personal preference. Generally, we recommend having your home exterior washed at least once a year to keep it in prime condition.  </p>

        <h2>5. How much does it cost to pressure wash my property?</h2>
        <p>Cost depends on the size and complexity of the job. We offer free estimates to give you an accurate price, as well as a number of packages to give you the best service for your property. Please contact us to schedule an appointment.</p>

        <h2>6. Do I need to be home during the pressure washing process?</h2>
        <p>No! Our technicians will knock on the front door prior to beginning service to ensure that any occupants are aware of our presence and avoid surprises, but nobody is home for about half of our jobs. We do pride ourselves on communication; you'll receive a text when we arrive, and after the work is complete.</p>

        <h2>7. Can you remove mold, mildew, and algae from my property?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we use a proprietary chemical blend to safely remove mold, mildew, algae, and other organics..</p>

        <h2>8. How long will it take to complete the pressure washing service?</h2>
        <p>Most residential jobs will take a few short hours, depending on the service package and the amount of work involved..
